# machine-learning-oxazolidinone-dataset

This repository contains the dataset for oxazolidnones for docking and virtual screening in ribosomal targets. If you plan to use this dataset for your study, please reference the paper: Molecular descriptor-based machine-learning assisted QSAR model development for ribosomal oxazolidinone activity.

This dataset is comprised of 530 oxazolidinone and linezolid deriviates. All are listed in mol2 format and SMILES.
